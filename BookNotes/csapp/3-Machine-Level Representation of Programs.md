# Program Encodings
- The format and behavior of a machine-level program is deﬁned by the *instruction set architecture*, or ISA, deﬁning the processor state, the format of the instructions, and the effect each of these instructions will have on the state（每条指令对状态的影响）.

	- processor state: program count, register file etc.
- C provides a model in which objects of different data types can be declared and allocated in memory, machine code views the memory as simply a large byte addressable array. 
	- Aggregate (聚合) data types in C such as arrays and structures are represented in machine code as contiguous（连续的） collections of bytes. 
	- Even for scalar（标量） data types, assembly code makes no distinctions（区分） between signed or unsigned integers, between different types of pointers, or even between pointersand integers.

- The program memory contains the executable machine code for the program,some information required by the operating system, a run-time stack for managing procedure calls and returns, and blocks of memory allocated by the user (e.g., by using the malloc library function).
