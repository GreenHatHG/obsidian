# Information Storage
- Rather than accessing individual bits in memory, most computers use blocks of 8 bits, or bytes, as the smallest addressable unit of memory.
- A machine-level program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as `virtual memory`. 
- Every byte of memory is identiﬁed by a unique number, known as its `address`, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the `virtual address space`.

## Addressing and Byte Ordering
### Byte Ordering
- question setting: For program objects that span (跨越) multiple bytes, we must establish two conventions（建立两个约定）: what the address of the object will be（object 的地址是怎么样的）, and how we will order the bytes in memory. [**P71**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=dc5ad5f2-7286-260e-a005-cec0e32f2057&page=71&rect=161.798,502.613,508.507,526.274)
- In virtually (几乎) all machines, a multi-byte object is stored as a contiguous (连续) sequence of bytes, with the address of the object given by the smallest address of the bytes used. 
	- For example, suppose a variable `x` of type int has address 0x100; that is, the value of the address expression `&x` is 0x100. Then (assuming data type int has a32-bit representation) the 4 bytes of x would be stored in memory locations 0x100,0x101, 0x102, and 0x103.

- For ordering the bytes representing an object, there are two common conventions.

	- **little endian**: the least signiﬁcant byte comes ﬁrst. [**P71**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=41136916-5083-d515-60b9-2de8aa159f56&page=71&rect=161.801,323.285,508.539,346.946)
	- **big endian**: the most signiﬁcant byte comes ﬁrst. [**P71**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=b88e00cb-4f75-27c7-2bc8-8302adbdbda1&page=71&rect=161.801,311.330,508.509,334.991)
	- 最左位：least signiﬁcant byte (lsb)，最右位：most signiﬁcant byte（msb）
- Many recent microprocessor chips are bi-endian (双端), meaning that they can be conﬁgured to operate as either little- or big-endian machines. [**P72**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=d8cb378b-7909-4a93-19b7-6c9b0ab7e64a&page=72&rect=103.500,296.570,450.238,332.186)
	- In practice, however, byte ordering becomes ﬁxed once aparticular operating system is chosen.

	- ARM microprocessors, used in many cell phones, have hardware that can operate in either little- or big-endian mode [**P72**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=abda0dde-b899-940a-1f41-c1a7f7754d85&page=72&rect=103.500,260.705,450.218,296.321)
	- Android(from Google) and IOS (from Apple)—operate only in little-endian mode.[**P72**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=c3d6de79-211c-46b1-6ff5-3a2dd7d95ae5&page=72&rect=103.500,248.750,450.218,272.411)
### Byte Ordering Issue
- Binary data produced by a little-endian machine to be sent to a big-endian machine. [**P73**](obsidian://booknote?type=annotation&book=book/Computer%20Systems.%20A%20Programmer%E2%80%99s%20Perspective%203rd%20Edition%20Global%20Edition.pdf&id=bf67ca9f-1f50-840f-8cc7-e3eeb5026c65&page=73&rect=161.800,631.315,508.469,654.976)
	- To avoid such problems, code written for networking applications must follow established conventions (既定惯例) for byte ordering to make sure the sending machine converts its internal representation to the network standard, while the receiving machine converts the network standard to its internal representation.
